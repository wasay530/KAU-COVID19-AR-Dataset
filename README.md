## Dataset of Mobile Sensors based Human Physical Activities Recognition to Pandemic Spread Minimization (KAU-COVID19-AR-Dataset)

* This repo describes a data collection campaign and a set of resulting data obtained from smartphone sensors that show useful functions in reducing the spread of COVID-19 (epidemic). 
* Database is released as a collection of CSV files containing more than 37K data samples, where each sample is composed of 7 features related to many mobile sensors, including accelerometer, gyroscope, speed, and GPS sensors, with the help of our application that we developed using Flutter application development platform. 
* First we collect the each sensor data locally in mobile device in a CSV format and then send this that to the PostgreSQL server. 
* In addition, a sample of each data is associated with a basic truth label that describes the user’s activity and the situation in which he or she was involved during a sensory examination (e.g., handshakes, hand washing, hand sanitizing and eyes nose and mouth touching, etc.). 
* To avoid introducing any bias during data collection, we performed a field-based sensory examination, that is, using multiple companies mobile devices, and without identifying any barriers to user behavior when performing any activity.
* The set of data collected represents a useful real data source to describe and evaluate a comprehensive set of novel activities aimed at helping to reduce the spread of COVID-19.

#### Value of the data ####
* This data is collected by performing multiple activities e.g. washing sanitizing and shaking hands, walking, sitting, standing, and drinking water, can be used
to build pandemic spread minimization system.
* The data can be used for behaviour analysis of individual, and group of peoples, and also helpful for the healthcare monitoring, health surveillance, medical
and disability assistance.
* The structure and quantity of data can be used for various activity detection tasks such as classification, recognition, and prediction.
* This dataset is - as far as we know - the first publicly available physical activities dataset for the pandemic spread minimization.

#### Dataset Description ####
* The novel dataset (KAU−COVID19−AR−dataset) collects by performing multiple activities such as washing hands, hand sanitizing, shaking hands, touching the nose
eyes or mouth, sitting, standing, walking and drinking water.
* The location of the smartphone is very important for the acquisition and higher accuracy of the dataset. Place your smartphone in a compatible watch-like position. Figure 1 shows the placement of the position on the smartphone.
* The location of the smartphone is similar to the location of Figure 1: Position of Mobile phone is (arm Position) for activity data collection the smartwatch that has achieved market penetration of in the past [[4]](#4).

* It is important to note that the position of the smartphone on the participant’s body is fixed. 
* For in these experiments, we used smartphones from various companies.
* The orientation of the smartphone was vertically along the forearm. 
* Data for all activities was recorded at 10 samples per second. This sampling rate (10 samples per seconds) is sufficient to detect human physical activity [[3]](#3).
* Figure 2: Dataset (KAU−COVID19−AR−Dataset): Each activity In addition, recent advances have shown that less than 10 samples per second is insufficient for activity detection [[1]](#1)[[2]](#2).

* Accelerometer, gyroscope, and speed sensor data are acquired at a speed of 10 samples per second, and GPSsensor data data are acquired at a speed of 1 sample per 
seconds [[5]](#5).
